How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

   The changes that caused the bug could be found easier

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

    you can track all the changes that were made and re use the previews versions in the future

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

 you commit changes when it is logical to do
 you can forget to commit changes

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

 when you write code multiple files can wokr togetheer as one so you want to know the changes commited to all of them

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

 whith git log you can view when a change was commited and some commnet about it. with git diff you can see the changes in two versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

 whith version control yo can go back to a version that was working even if you dont know what caused the bug
