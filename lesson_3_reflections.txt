Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 you might be working on something in your project so you dont want changes to happen before you complete your work

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
 fork is used when you dont hve permission to make changes to a repository or you want to make something different. with fork your new project will point to the origanl. clone is when you want to transfer a project so you can work localy and sync the changes after. branch is a way of developing a project in different ways so you can test new things safe and decide afterwards what to keep and combine in the main project

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
 you can see the changes that were made and decide if and how to merge it later with your version
