When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 with a remote repository is easy to share your work and collaborate with others. it is very usefull in open projects when you might want to make your project public so other can contribute

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 you might be working on something in your project so you dont want changes to happen before you complete your work

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
 fork is used when you dont hve permission to make changes to a repository or you want to make something different. with fork your new project will point to the origanl. clone is when you want to transfer a project so you can work localy and sync the changes after. branch is a way of developing a project in different ways so you can test new things safe and decide afterwards what to keep and combine in the main project

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
 you can see the changes that were made and decide if and how to merge it later with your version

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
 without using git or github an option would be a common storage but it would be hard to track the differencies and the changes. and wouldnt do automatic merge to see conflics. it would be hard to try things. the only thing it might would be easier is  ho to save and store files 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
 you can use a different branch to test things and collaboate with others. you can send pull requests to others to check your changes before merge them to the master
